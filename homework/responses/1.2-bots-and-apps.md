# Bots and Apps

Now that you better understand Bolt and Slack, it is time to learn about different types of projects we can build on Slack! This issue will cover the differences between a Slack **app** and a Slack **bot**. 

## ðŸ“š Reading

First, read this [short explanation](https://slack.com/resources/slack-101/what-is-an-app) on what an app is, then read this [article about bots](https://api.slack.com/bot-users#:~:text=A%20bot%20is%20a%20type,a%20Slack%20App%20can%20do.).

## ðŸ§  Brainstorm

The article on bots listed a couple of their use cases, including:

* Sending DMs!
* Posting messages!
* Uploading files!

Come up with 2-3 ideas for a Slack app and 2 ideas for a bot and leave them as comments. These ideas don't have to consider any logistics, and can be as simple or complex as you would like!
