# Shortcuts

All great projects enable users to access different features easily. Entry points are Slack's way of helping you develop apps with this goal in mind.  Look over [this article](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/entry-points) on Slack's different entry points to see what tools are at your disposal. 

## 📚 Reading Up 

This week will be focused on making a shortcut as the entry point for our app. Read through [this guide](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/shortcuts) (including the guides for each type of shortcut). Then, comment the difference between a global and message shortcut, as well as an idea for each type. 



## 🧑‍💻 Test it Out!

Now it is time to see a shortcut in action! Follow [these instructions](https://slack.com/help/articles/206845317-Create-a-Slack-workspace) to create a new workspace, then [add some shortcuts](https://bitdarlene.slack.com/apps/collection/shortcuts) to it. After you are done exploring, you can delete the workspace or keep it as a testing environment for future projects.
